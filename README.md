# SQL Editor (with GUI)

This project encapsulates a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** based Database Management System (DBMS) developed in **C++** with a **JavaFX** front-end. It offers an interactive interface for users to manipulate databases, tables, and records. The system is designed to interpret and execute SQL-like commands, enabling a comprehensive suite of operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data.

The GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly environment for interacting with the database, improving upon the original command-line interface. Users can now execute SQL queries directly within the JavaFX application, visualize table structures, and receive real-time feedback on their queries.

Additionally, the system now supports a wider range of SQL queries, enhancing its versatility for database management tasks. The **C++ native code** has been integrated into JavaFX, offering performance and functionality improvements. The C++ code has been adapted from an earlier project to fit the native format, and the modified code (with minor changes) can be found in the `cpp` folder within `src`.

> The primary motivation behind this project was to master **JavaFX** and various data structures in the Java programming language, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of integrating **native C++** with Java. 
>
> This project was developed as the [second university assignment](instructions.pdf) for "Practicum of Object-Oriented Programming" at the University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering majoring in Software Engineering. Please refer to the file for detailed assignment instructions.
